Vision: A smarter, more efficient resume tool that grows with you and treats your work history like a living document, not a one-time task.



What input should the user provide?

User should be able to provide resume content in raw format (paragraph form), as well as a ATS-friendly template resume (PDF, HTML)

What output will tool generate?

Goal is for prompt2resume to be able to generate a pdf. Wish to create an MVP

How is this tool unique or different from other tools?

This tool will be able to provide Git-style snapshots, enabling to see all resumes generated & recoverable; it is Open-source and Prompt-driven.
Some other features I thought of if I have time are if a resume can be scored based on design only (would require sample data and training an LLM); can also store every prompt entry for more efficient resume generation
